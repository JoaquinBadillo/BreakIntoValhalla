# Utilities

This folder contains utility scripts. Most of them are used to read and write data from and to the database through the API using Unity's `UnityWebRequest` class and the JSON utilities. Other utilities are general purpose scripts that help to manage the game, for instance spawning objects, blocking locked doors, etc.
