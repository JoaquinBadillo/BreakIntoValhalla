# Utilities

This folder contains utility scripts that are used to read and write data from and to the database. This is done through the API using Uinity's `UnityWebRequest` class and the JSON utilities.

Some of this utilites are used by the login screen to save data to PlayerPrefs, others are used to read and write data to the database through the Game Manager.
